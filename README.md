# SOSA — Scalable Orchestrator for Self‑Play and Analysis (Chess)

SOSA is a multi‑module Java project that orchestrates chess games and analysis across distributed workers. It integrates with Lichess for live games and uses RabbitMQ to coordinate work between a master process and workers. The project is built with Spring Boot 3, Java 21, and Maven.

## Modules

- model: Shared messages and domain model used across modules.
- worker: Engine worker that plays/moves/analyses positions on demand.
- worker-init: Initialization worker that prepares a game/session before the main worker takes over.
- master: Head node that integrates with Lichess, produces jobs/messages, and coordinates workers.

## Key Technologies

- Java 21, Spring Boot 3
- RabbitMQ for messaging
- chariot (Lichess API client)
- chesstango (board/engine) and gardel (chess notation/encoding)
- Kubernetes manifests under k8s for deployment

## Architecture Overview

- master subscribes to events and drives the workflow.
  - Integrates with Lichess (challenge bots/users, watch games).
  - Publishes messages to RabbitMQ (exchange: see Constants.CHESS_TANGO_EXCHANGE in code) such as GameStart, StartPosition, GoFast, GameEnd.
- worker-init receives early game setup messages and prepares the session.
- worker performs the heavy lifting (engine interactions, move generation, analysis).
- model defines the shared message classes (e.g., StartPosition, GameStart, GameEnd).

## Prerequisites

- JDK 21+
- Maven 3.9+
- RabbitMQ instance accessible to master and workers
- (Optional) Lichess account and API token if using Lichess integration
- Docker and Kubernetes if deploying via k8s manifests

## Building

Use the Maven wrapper from the repo root:

- On Windows: mvnw.cmd clean install
- On Linux/macOS: ./mvnw clean install

This builds all modules: model, worker, worker-init, master.

## Running Locally

At minimum, master requires RabbitMQ connection details. If using Lichess integration, provide a bot or user token.

Environment variables used by master (see master/src/main/resources/application.yaml):

- BOT_TOKEN: Lichess token used by the bot/user (optional unless using Lichess).
- CHALLENGE_JOB: true|false — Enable periodic challenging of opponents (default false).
- CHALLENGE_TYPES: comma list of time controls (e.g., bullet,blitz,rapid).
- GAME_WATCHDOG: true|false — Enable watchdog to track/expire games (default false).
- RABBIT_HOST: RabbitMQ host.
- RABBIT_USER: RabbitMQ username.
- RABBIT_PASSWORD: RabbitMQ password.

You can also see an example of local configuration under k8s/environments/local/master-configMap.yaml.

Run modules with Spring Boot after building:

- Master: from the master module directory, run mvnw spring-boot:run (or java -jar target/master-*.jar with env vars).
- Worker / worker-init: similarly run via spring-boot:run or the shaded JARs, ensuring they point to the same RabbitMQ.

## Kubernetes Deployment

Kubernetes manifests live under k8s/ with environment overlays:

- k8s/environments/local: example local ConfigMap values (e.g., CHALLENGE_JOB, GAME_WATCHDOG, CHALLENGE_TYPES).
- Additional environment directories (dev, common) can be adapted per cluster.

Typical steps:

1. Prepare a Kubernetes namespace and a RabbitMQ service/secret.
2. Create ConfigMaps and Secrets with required environment variables (e.g., BOT_TOKEN, RABBIT_*).
3. Apply Deployments/Services for master, worker, worker-init (manifests not shown here; customize as needed).

## Development Notes

- Java version configured via pom.xml properties: java.version=21.
- Dependencies managed centrally in the root pom (chesstango, gardel, chariot, commons-collections).
- Spring Boot main application type for master is non-web (batch/daemon).
- Messaging: master publishes to an exchange and uses routing keys based on worker IDs (see GameProducer for examples).

## Testing

Run all tests:

- mvnw.cmd test (Windows) or ./mvnw test (Linux/macOS)

Module-specific tests can be executed by running Maven from the module directory.

## Troubleshooting

- RabbitMQ connection errors: verify RABBIT_HOST, RABBIT_USER, RABBIT_PASSWORD, and that ports are accessible.
- Lichess authentication issues: ensure BOT_TOKEN has proper scopes and the account/bot is enabled.
- No challenges sent: set CHALLENGE_JOB=true and define CHALLENGE_TYPES; ensure the app logs show Lichess connectivity.
- Timeouts/watchdog: GAME_WATCHDOG controls a scheduler; verify timing settings (challengeExpire, gameExpire) in application.yaml.
